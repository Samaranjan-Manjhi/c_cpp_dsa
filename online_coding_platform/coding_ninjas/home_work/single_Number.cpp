Single Number 

 Problem statement

You are given an array A of length N, where N is always an odd integer. There are (N-1)/2 elements in the array that occur twice and one element which occurs once.

Your task is to find the only element that occurs once in the array.
Note: There are (N-1)/2+1 elements that are unique in the array.
Example:

Consider the array be 1,6,4,6,2,4,2
The integers 2, 4, 6 occur twice and only the integer 1 occurs once. 

Sample Input 1:
7
7 3 5 4 5 3 4
Sample Output 1:
7

Explanation For Sample Input 1:
The integers 3, 4, 5 occur twice and only the integer 7 occurs once.

Sample Input 2:
9
5 6 9 6 1 9 1 5 3
Sample Output 2:
3

Explanation For Sample Input 2:
The integers 1, 5, 6, 9 occur twice and only the integer 3 occurs once.

Expected Time Complexity:
O(N), where ‘N’ is the length of the given array

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^4
-10^6 <=  A[i] <=10^6
Where T denotes the number of test cases and N denotes the length of array A[].
Time Limit: 1 sec
