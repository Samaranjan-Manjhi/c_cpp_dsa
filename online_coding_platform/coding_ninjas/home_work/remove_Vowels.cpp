Remove Vowels

 Problem statement

You are given a string STR of length N. Your task is to remove all the vowels present in that string and print the modified string.

English alphabets ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘o’, ‘u’ are termed as vowels. All other alphabets are called consonants.

Note: You have to only remove vowels from the string. There will be no change in the relative position of all other alphabets.
For example:

(i)  If the input string is 'CodeGeek', the output should be CdGk after removing ‘o’ and ‘e’.

(ii) If the input string is 'Odinson', the output should be 'dnsn' after removing ‘o’ and ‘i’. 

Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^4

STR may contain alphabets from 'a' to 'z' or 'A' to 'Z' and blank spaces.

Time Limit: 1 sec 

Sample Input 1:

2
Mobile
CodingNinjas

Sample Output 1:

Mbl
