Mean Median Mode 

 Problem statement

You are given an array 'ARR' of 'N' integers and you have to calculate 3 things for the given array:-

1. Mean - function mean(): This function should calculate the mean of the array.

2. Median - function median(): This function should calculate the median of the array.

3. Mode - function mode(): This function should calculate the mode of the array.
Note :

It can be shown that Mean and Median is in the form of P/Q, where P and Q are coprime integers and Q != 0. You need to return P and Q.

For Mode, if the highest frequency of more than one element is the same, return the smallest element.

For Example, for the given array {1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4}, the mode will be 1 as it is the smallest of all the possible modes i.e 1, 2 and 3.

Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Constraints :

1 <= T <= 5
1 <= N <= 10^5 
1 <= ARR[i] <= 10^6 

Where 'ARR[i]' denotes the 'ith' element of the array.

Time limit: 1 sec

Sample input 1 :

1
4  
3 3 1 4 

Sample output 1 :

11 4
3 1
3

Explanation of sample input 1 :

To find the mean, we will take the sum of all the elements and then divide them by the total number of elements. Thus, (3 + 3 + 1 + 4)/4 = 11 / 4. Where P = 11 and Q = 4 and P, Q are coprime. 

To find the median, we will sort the array in ascending order and find the average of n/2 and (n/2 + 1)th number if N is even and (n+1)/2th number if N is odd. Thus, (3+3)/2 = 6 / 2. Thus P = 3 and Q = 1 and P, Q are coprimes.

To find the mode, we will find the element with the highest frequency which is 3 with a frequency of two and thus, the Mode is 3.  

Sample input 2 :

1
5
7 6 5 5 3

Sample output 2 :

26 5 
5 1 
5
