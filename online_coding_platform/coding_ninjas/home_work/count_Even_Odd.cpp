Count Even Odd

 Problem statement

You have been given an array/list of integers 'ARR' of size 'N'. Your task is to find two things-

1. The number of elements that are occurring an Odd number of times.

2. The number of elements that are occurring Even a number of times.
For Example:

ARR = [2, 1, 2, 1, 5, 5, 2]    
Output: 1 2 

2 occurs three(odd) times.
1 occurs two(even) times.
5 occurs two(even) times.

So, the total 1 element is occurring an odd number of times and 2 elements are occurring an even number of times.

Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Constraints:

1 <= T <= 10^2
0 <= N <= 5 * 10^3
1 <= ARR[i] <= 10^9

Time Limit: 1 sec

Output Format:

For each test case, print two single space-separated integers representing the number of odd occurring elements and number of even occurring elements respectively.

The output of each test case will be printed a separate line.

Note:

You are not required to print the output, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the function. 

Sample Input 1:

2
5
4 5 1 2 1
4
2 1 2 1 

Sample Output 1:

3 1
0 2

Explanation for Sample 1:

In the first test case, three integers(4, 5 and 2) occur odd times and the only integer 1 occurs even times.

In the second test case, no integer occurs odd times and two integers(1 and 2) occurs even times.

Sample Input 2:

1
8
5 2 9 9 7 5 1 3

Sample Output 2:

4 2
