/*

Product Of Array Except Self

 Problem statement

You have been given an integer array/list (ARR) of size N. You have to return an array/list PRODUCT such that PRODUCT[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of ARR except ARR[i]
 Note :

Each product can cross the integer limits, so we should take modulo of the operation. 
Take MOD = 10^9 + 7 to always stay in the limits.

Follow up :
Can you try solving the problem in O(1) space?

Constraints :
1 <= T <= 100
0 <= N <= 10^5
0 <= ARR[i] <= 10^5
Time Limit: 1 sec

Sample Input 1 :
2
3
1 2 3
3
5 2 2
Sample Output 1 :
6 3 2
4 10 10

Explanation for Sample Output 1 :
 Test case 1 : Given array = {1, 2, 3] 
 Required array = [2 * 3, 1 * 3, 1 * 2] = [6, 3, 2]
 Test case 2 : Given array = {5, 2, 2] 
 Required array = [2 * 2, 5 * 2, 5 * 2] = [4, 10, 10]

Sample Input 2 :
2
1
100
2
1 2
Sample Output 2 :
1
2 1
