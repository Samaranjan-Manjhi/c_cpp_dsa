Doubling the value

Given an array arr and an integer b, traverse the array (from the beginning) and if the element in array is b, double b and continue traversal. Find the value of b after the complete traversal.

Examples :

Input: b = 2, arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 8]
Output: 16
Explanation: b is initially 2. We get 2 at the 1st index, hence b becomes 4. 
Next, we get b 3rd time, hence b becomes 8. 
Next, we get b 4th time, hence b becomes 16.

Input: b = 3, arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 8]
Output: 6
Explanation: b is initially 3. We get 3 2nd time, hence b becomes 6.

Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 20
1 ≤ b ≤ 103
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 109

     vector<int> v(n);
     for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
          cin >> v[i];
