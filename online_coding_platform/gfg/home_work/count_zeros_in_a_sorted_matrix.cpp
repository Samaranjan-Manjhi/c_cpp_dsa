Count zeros in a sorted matrix

Given a n * n binary Square Matrix where each row and column of the matrix is sorted in ascending order. Find the total number of zeros present in the matrix.

Examples:

Input: mat[][] = [[0,0,0], [0,0,1], [0,1,1]]
 
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The first, second and third row contains 3, 2 and 1
zeroes respectively.

Input: mat[][] = [[1,1], [1,1]]
 
Output: 0
Explanation:
There are no zeroes in any of the rows.

Constraints
0 < n ≤ 10^3
0 ≤ mat[i][j] ≤ 1
